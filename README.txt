# Cassady_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My final project is a variation on the classic text-based adventure. RiddleQuest places the user in the first room of a maze. They are tasked with finding three artifacts, a silver chalice, a gold crown, and a magnificent ruby. The treasures must be aquired in order and cannot be picked up ahead of time. Each room in the dungeon has a unique riddle which the user must solve to continue.
